# EdX Improver Plugin

Pretty simple Chrome extension that improves the EdX video player in the following ways:
* Replaces the EdX media controls with the default HTML5 controls that come with Chrome
  * ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3819844/156684057-6a807832-b169-4b4a-9ea0-e944f96bfa02.png)
  * Also enables Picture in Picture ability
* Adds back spacebar to play/pause, double-click to go fullscreen, and skip/replay with arrow keys
* Adds a really basic dark mode toggle
* Adds a new "settings" icon to the player that lets you add intro skipping
