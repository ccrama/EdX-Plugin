# EdX Improver Plugin

Pretty simple Chrome extension that improves the EdX video player in the following ways:
* Replaces the EdX media controls with the default HTML5 controls that come with Chrome
* Adds back spacebar to play/pause, double-click to go fullscreen, and skip/replay with arrow keys
* Adds a really basic dark mode toggle
* Adds a new "settings" icon to the player that lets you add intro skipping

# Installing the plugin
1. Download the source code and unzip to your computer
2. Visit chrome://extensions
3. Enable "Developer Mode" (top-right)
4. Select "load unpacked"
5. Done! Refresh your EdX windows


PRs are always welcome!
